{"id": "BIO315H5S20191", "code": "BIO315H5S", "name": "Human Cell Biology", "description": "This course uses the information learned in prerequisite courses to cover advanced details in specific areas. The course will also introduce students to many exciting new topics in the structure and function of normal and diseased cells. Areas of focus include cell adhesion, intercellular communication, signal transduction, the cytoskeleton, chemotaxis, motor proteins, receptor mediated endocytosis and intracellular trafficking with an eye towards understanding their underlying roles in the disease process. Throughout the course, students will learn about the underlying approaches, methods and experimentation used by biomedical researchers including polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, western blotting, immunolocalization, pharmacological intervention and various means of localizing proteins within cells.
