{"id": "BIO201H5S20191", "code": "BIO201H5S", "name": "The Biology Behind the News", "description": "News stories are used to explore areas of biology, to learn about the process of science, and to find and assess the validity of information. The topics for the course modules will change yearly because the course is designed to give students the tools to explore the biology behind the news, not to teach a comprehensive survey of biological facts. Reading, writing, and research skills are emphasized. This is a biology course for students in the Humanities and Social Sciences as well as other non-Biology Sciences.
