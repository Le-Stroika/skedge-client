It will address questions about how we advance knowledge, who controls how and what we learn and what role education has in how societies are shaped, changed and reproduced. Students will evaluate the influence education can have on who we are, how we wish to live and what we aspire to as citizens in a global and digital community. This investigation will also consider how language, race, gender, class and culture intersect with teaching and learning.", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Language Studies", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 100, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["I Danjoux"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 68400, "duration": 7200, "location": "DV 2074"}], "size": 250, "enrolment": 0}]}
