{"id": "CHM397H5S20191", "code": "CHM397H5S", "name": "Analytical and Physical Chemistry Instrumentation Laboratory II", "description": "This analytical and physical chemistry laboratory course carries on from CHM396 to introduce more advanced topics in instrumental methods of analysis and physical chemistry concepts. The course will include experimental modules focused on instrument design and computer interfacing, molecular spectroscopy (e.g. fluorescence, infrared and Raman, and NMR), plasmon resonance methods for biomolecule determinations and kinetic analysis, microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip technologies. The course will provide practical experience in the optimization of instrumental analytical measurements, experiment design, and topics of relevance to research in analytical and physical chemistry.
