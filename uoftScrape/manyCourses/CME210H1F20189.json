General biaxial and triaxial stress conditions in continua are studied, as are elastic stress, strain and deformation relations for members subjected to axial load, bending and shear. Properties of plane sections, moment-area theorems for calculating deflection, and Mohr\u2019s circle representation of stress and of moment of inertia are examined, followed by a look at stability.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil and Mineral Engineering", "prerequisites": "CIV100H1, MAT186H1, MAT187H1", "exclusions": "CIV210H1", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["F Habibi"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 116"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 116"}], "size": 115, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "HA 53"}], "size": 75, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "BA 1200"}], "size": 75, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "HA 53"}], "size": 75, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "BA 1200"}], "size": 75, "enrolment": 0}]}
