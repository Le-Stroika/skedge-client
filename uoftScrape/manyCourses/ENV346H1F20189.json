Geological, hydrological, biological, cosmological and oceanographic energy systems are considered in the context of the Earth as a dynamic system, including the variation of solar energy received by the planet and the redistribution of this energy through various radiative, latent and sensible heat transfer mechanisms. It considers the energy redistribution role of large-scale atmospheric systems, of warm and cold ocean currents, the role of the polar regions, and the functioning of various hydrological systems. The contribution and influence of tectonic systems on the surface systems is briefly introduced, as well the important role of energy storage processes in physical and biological systems, including the accumulation of fossil fuel reserves.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "School of Environment", "prerequisites": "(MAT135H1, MAT136H1)/MAT135Y1/ MAT137Y1/ JMB170Y1; BIO120H1/ BIO150Y1/ CHM136H1/ CHM138H1/ CHM1135H1/ CHM139H1/ CHM151Y1/ PHY131H1/ PHY132H1/ PHY151H1/ PHY152H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["I Sinclair"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "MC 102"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MC 102"}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L2001", "instructors": ["I Sinclair"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "MC 102"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MC 102"}], "size": 10, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T5101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 72000, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2179"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}]}
