Are puzzles just playful artefacts, intended merely to entertain? Or are they mirrors of something much more fundamental in human life? The course will take a close look at what puzzles tell us about the human mind and human culture. Not eligible for CR/NCR option. In this course an additional fee of up to $50 may be charged for activities outside of the classroom (e.g., field trips). Such fees will be confirmed in the course syllabus.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Victoria College", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "Innis One, Munk One, New One, SMC One, Trinity One, UC One, Vic One, Woodsworth One; 199 seminars or other Vic One Hundred seminars.", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [2], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Danesi"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "NF 006"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "NF 006"}], "size": 34, "enrolment": 0}]}
