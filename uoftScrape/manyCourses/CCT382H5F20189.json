{"id": "CCT382H5F20189", "code": "CCT382H5F", "name": "Digital Games and Learning", "description": "Students will be introduced to Multimedia Knowledge Management by working on and building a prototype of an educational interactive knowledge game. Addressing issues of Digital Media design, students in collaborative groups will develop and/or employ appropriate research methodologies, read relevant material to design the game flow, create characters, and design storyboards / wireframes. Students will identify an educational need, define requirements, and develop a web-based interactive game to meet them. They will conduct iterative usability testing and finally build a website featuring their semi-functional prototype. The course does not require programming experience, but a familiarity with web design, image rendering, and animation software could be an asset.
