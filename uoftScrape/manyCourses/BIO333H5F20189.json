Lectures cover water chemistry; the physical structure of lakes; the different ways that algae, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, and fish have evolved to succeed in these habitats and interact with one another; and the impact of man on freshwater systems. Students must be available to participate in a mandatory weekend field trip to a lake on one of two weekends in late September or early October. Students not available for one of those weekends should not register for this course. Ancillary fees for this course apply. Please check the Departmental website for full details.
