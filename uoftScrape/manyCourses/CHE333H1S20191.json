{"id": "CHE333H1S20191", "code": "CHE333H1S", "name": "Chemical Reaction Engineering", "description": "Covers the basics of simple reactor design and performance, with emphasis on unifying the concepts in kinetics, thermodynamics and transport phenomena. Topics include flow and residence time distributions in various reactor types as well as the influence of transport properties (bulk and interphase) on kinetics and reactor performance. The interplay of these facets of reaction engineering is illustrated by use of appropriate computer simulations.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["B Saville"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 2118"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "PB B150"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 255"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 150"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 0}]}
