This includes a discussion of the mechanisms of step growth, chain growth and ring-opening polymerizations with a focus on industrially relevant polymers and processes. The description of polymers in solution as well as the solid state will be explored.\u00a0 Several modern polymer characterization techniques are introduced including gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis and others.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "CHM426H1", "level": 500, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["P Yaneff"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 64800, "duration": 10800, "location": "RS 208"}], "size": 35, "enrolment": 0}]}
