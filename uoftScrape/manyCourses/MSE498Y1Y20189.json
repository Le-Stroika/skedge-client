{"id": "MSE498Y1Y20189", "code": "MSE498Y1Y", "name": "Capstone Team Design Project", "description": "The students are organized in small groups, select a project involving original research and design work which is normally closely related to the current work of a faculty member, and can be in close collaboration with an external partner (e.g. local industry, hospital, government lab). The students conceive and carry out a research plan under the supervision of the academic staff member and with an external liaison person as a resource person if required. The project must contain a significant design component. The project work may be carried out in the department, at the external site, or both locations. The final grade will be based on interim and final written reports, an oral presentation at the end of the fall term and a final poster presentation at the end of the winter term.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Materials Science and Engineering", "prerequisites": "permission of the Department", "exclusions": "CHM499Y1", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": ["M Barati Sedeh"], "times": [], "size": 65, "enrolment": 0}]}
