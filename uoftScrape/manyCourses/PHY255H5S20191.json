{"id": "PHY255H5S20191", "code": "PHY255H5S", "name": "Introduction to Biomedical Physics", "description": "The course focuses on applying principles from introductory Physics to biomedical phenomena. The goal is to illustrate the application of physical principles in life sciences and how this enhances one's understanding of biology. Topics may vary but they will include: the elasticity of muscles, the flow of blood, the electrical signal propagation in nerve cells, the optical properties of the eye, and the sound generation in vocal cords. In addition, the physical basis of medical techniques such as ultrasound imaging, endoscopy, electrocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, laser surgery, and radiation therapy will be treated quantitatively.
