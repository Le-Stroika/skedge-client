We will consider the process of theory change, whether theory choice is rational, and whether theoretical terms, such as light and space preserve their meanings across revolutions. In addition to classic work by Kuhn, we shall consider approaches that were inspired by Kuhn\u2019s work. In particular, we will consider the approaches of sociologists of scientific knowledge. The course is taught as a seminar in which the students play an active role in presenting and discussing the readings.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Inst. for the History & Philosophy of Science & Technology", "prerequisites": "HPS250H1 or by permission of the instructor", "exclusions": "HPS350H1", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Berkovitz"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "VC 304"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}]}
