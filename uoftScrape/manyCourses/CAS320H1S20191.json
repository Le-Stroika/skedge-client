While colonial empires have declined, new empires have emerged, and a growing number of countries have witnessed the rise of nationalism and independent states, social, political and technological revolutions, and most recently neoliberal globalization. This course theorizes and explores these dramatic changes in a comparative framework. It is aimed at students wishing to better understand the great transformations of modern Asia in a global context.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Contemporary East and Southeast Asian Studies", "prerequisites": "CAS200Y1 or CAS201H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["A Sundar"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 1072"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}]}
