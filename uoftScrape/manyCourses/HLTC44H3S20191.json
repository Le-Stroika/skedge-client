In this course students will explore questions such as: which systems and which public/private sector mixes are better at achieving efficiency and equity? How do these different systems deal with tough choices, such as decisions about new technologies? The set of international health care systems we focus on are likely to vary by term but will include a subset of OECD countries as well as countries with large populations that are heavily represented in Toronto such as China and India.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Interdisciplinary Centre for Health and Society (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "HLTB40H3", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["G Fazli"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "HW 215"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}]}
