Its purpose is to give students an opportunity to integrate the Industrial Engineering tools learned in previous courses by applying them to real world problems. While the specific focus of the case studies used to illustrate the application of Industrial Engineering will be the Canadian health care system, the approach to problem solving adopted in this course will be applicable to any setting. This course will provide a framework for identifying and resolving problems in a complex, unstructured decision-making environment. It will give students the opportunity to apply a problem identification framework through real world case studies. The case studies will involve people from the health care industry bringing current practical problems to the class. Students work in small groups preparing a feasibility study discussing potential approaches. Although the course is directed at Industrial Engineering fourth year and graduate students, it does not assume specific previous knowledge, and the course is open to students in other disciplines.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Mechanical & Industrial Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 500, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Carter"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 405"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MC 254"}], "size": 80, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 119"}], "size": 80, "enrolment": 0}]}
