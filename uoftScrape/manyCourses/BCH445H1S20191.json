{"id": "BCH445H1S20191", "code": "BCH445H1S", "name": "Organelles in Cell Function and Death", "description": "Advanced principles and concepts of cell biology are covered including the structure, biogenesis, and dynamic behavior of cell organelles. The specific contributions to the life and death of the cell are highlighted. Signaling events that integrate cellular communication are discussed. Specifically, the interplay between the Endoplasmic Reticulum, Peroxisomes and Mitochondria is highlighted. Mitochondrial biogenesis and membrane dynamics as they relate to apoptosis and cellular signaling/integration are presented as they relate to human disease. State-of-the-art imaging techniques and the contributions of cell biology to modern day advances in medicine are also presented.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Biochemistry", "prerequisites": "BCH210H1/BCH242Y1; BIO230H1/BIO255H1; BCH311H1/MGY311Y1/PSL350H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D Andrews P Kim A McQuibban"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "HA 401"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}]}
