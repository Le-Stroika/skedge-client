We focus on behaviour-genetic analysis of olfaction, foraging, rhythms and sex in three model systems (the worm C. elegans, the fruit fly D. melanogaster and the mouse). We discuss how information from these model organisms can be used to shed light on behaviour genetics of non-model organisms including humans.
