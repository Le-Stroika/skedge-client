Students explore the theory of psychic space, working to understand how the creation of that space operates to advance audience engagement. Classwork explores the furnishing and unfurnishing of psychic space in relation to meaning and characterization. Students focus on a small set of characters they develop over time via a writing portfolio. The course considers the impacts of place, incident, narrative arc, and complication-resolution models, with reference to theories by Gerke, French, Wolfe, and Van Manen. Weekly exercises and assignments focus on developing believable, memorable characters. Readings include a mix of student-authored and contemporary professional works.", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Institute of Communication and Culture", "prerequisites": "2.0 WRI credits", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Currie"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "CC 3124"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}]}
