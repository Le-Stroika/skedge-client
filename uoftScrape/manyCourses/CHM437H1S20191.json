Topics include naturally occurring and medicinal ligands; transport, uptake and control of concentration of metal ions; and physical methods of characterization of metal binding sites. The roles of metal ions in nature are discussed, including as structural and signaling elements in proteins, nucleic acids and DNA-binding complexes and proteins; as Lewis-acid centres in enzymes; as carriers of electrons, atoms and groups in redox proteins and enzymes; and as sources of biominerals; as radiopharmaceuticals.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Chemistry", "prerequisites": "CHM238Y1", "exclusions": "CHM333H5, CHMD69H3", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Chin"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "LM 158"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "LM 158"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}]}
