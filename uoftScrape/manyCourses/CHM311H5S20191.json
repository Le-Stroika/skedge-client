{"id": "CHM311H5S20191", "code": "CHM311H5S", "name": "Instrumental Analytical Chemistry", "description": "Introduction to the basic theory and practice underlying important techniques in analytical chemistry, chosen from three major areas of instrumental analysis: spectroscopy, electrochemistry and separation science. Specific topics will include fluorescence spectroscopy, atomic spectroscopy, x-ray fluorescence, voltammetry, high resolution gas and liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and a brief introduction to computer applications, including Fourier transform methods. A problem-based approach will be used to explore these methods in a wide variety of practical applications.
