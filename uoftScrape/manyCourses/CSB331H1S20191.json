{"id": "CSB331H1S20191", "code": "CSB331H1S", "name": "Advanced Cell Biology I: Cellular Dynamics During Development", "description": "The development of multicellular organisms is dependent on complex cell-cell and cell-matrix dynamics. The course examines the molecules and mechanisms involved and how they act in concert to regulate distinct developmental and physiological events. Emphasis is placed on the experimental approaches and technology used to study the molecular interactions and dynamics that alter structure-function relationships in cells and organisms.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Cell and Systems Biology", "prerequisites": "BIO230H1/(BIO240H1, BIO241H1)/BIO255H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["S Plotnikov"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "RW 117"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "RW 117"}], "size": 156, "enrolment": 0}]}
