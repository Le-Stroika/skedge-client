Focus on three major topics: (1) visual computing principles\u2014computational and mathematical methods for creating, capturing, analyzing, and manipulating digital photographs (image acquisition, basic image processing, image warping, anti-aliasing); (2) digital special effects\u2014applying these principles to create special effects found in movies and commercials; (3) visual programming\u2014using C/C++ and OpenGL to create graphical user interfaces for synthesizing and manipulating photographs. The course requires the ability to use differential calculus in several variables and linear algebra.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Computer Science", "prerequisites": "CSC209H1/(CSC207H1, proficiency in C or C++); MAT221H1/MAT223H1/MAT240H1, (MAT136H1 with a minimum mark of 77)/(MAT137Y1 with a minimum mark of 73)/(MAT157Y1 with a minimum mark of 67)/MAT235Y1/MAT237Y1/MAT257Y1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["Y Ioannou Y Ma"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "GB 119"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 119"}], "size": 100, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L2501", "instructors": ["Y Ma Y Ioannou"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 72000, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1190"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 72000, "end": 75600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1190"}], "size": 10, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L5101", "instructors": ["Y Ma Y Ioannou"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 72000, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1190"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 72000, "end": 75600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1190"}], "size": 90, "enrolment": 0}]}
