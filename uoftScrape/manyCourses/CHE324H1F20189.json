{"id": "CHE324H1F20189", "code": "CHE324H1F", "name": "Process Design", "description": "This course presents the philosophy and typical procedures of chemical engineering design projects. The course begins at the design concept phase. Material and energy balances are reviewed along with the design of single unit operations and equipment specification sheets. The impact of recycles on equipment sizing is covered. Safety, health and environmental regulations are presented. These lead to the development of safe operating procedures. The systems for developing Piping and Instrumentation diagrams are presented. Process safety studies such as HAZOPS are introduced. Typical utility systems such as steam, air and vacuum are discussed. Project economics calculations are reviewed.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 255"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 255"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0103", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "GB 144"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["E Acosta"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1130"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1130"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0104", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 255"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}]}
