This course will cover different types of random spatial processes and how to incorporate them into mixed effects models for Normal and non-Normal data. Students will be trained in a variety of advanced techniques for analyzing complex spatial data and, upon completion, will be able to undertake a variety of analyses on spatially dependent data, understand which methods are appropriate for various research questions, and interpret and convey results in the light of the original questions posed.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Statistical Sciences", "prerequisites": "STA302H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D Simpson"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 1071"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 1071"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}]}
