{"id": "CCT385H5S20191", "code": "CCT385H5S", "name": "An Introduction to Media Environments", "description": "Marshall McLuhan was one of the first theorists to conceptualize media as an environment. Media were no longer an instrument or a tool but a system that would capture its audience within. Our contemporary media environments are multifarious; they are networked, immersive, and sometimes ubiguitous. We interface with these networks with different means: screens, goggles, watches, and devices that tap right into our brain. This course investigates different types of media environments from social media platforms; video game consoles; infrastructures and smart cities, to virtual and augmented realities and beyond. The course investigates how we interface with our environments, and how these environments structure and condition our possibilities. The question of media environments is thus also a question of culture and politics. Media environments are domains of artistic, scientific, and commercial experimentation and exploration. Students will be exposed to a variety of these technologies both from a conceptual and a practical perspective.
