Students will be required to perform two modules (one is completed in the Fall semester and the second is completed in the Winter semester); each module will provide minimum 90 hours of hands-on and/or observational activity. Students will select opportunities with faculty in laboratories classified within two (of four) different themes at the Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering (IBBME). Activities will provide exposure to experimental design, the use of analytical equipment, and assessment of relevant literature (scientific, patent, and regulatory) related to the research topic identified by the faculty member.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0You may only register in this course after obtaining approval from the Associate Director \u2013 Undergraduate IBBME.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Cross Disciplinary Programs Office", "prerequisites": "CHE353H1 or equivalent", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": ["D Kilkenny Rocheleau"], "times": [], "size": 15, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 320"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 0}]}
