{"id": "CSB430H1S20191", "code": "CSB430H1S", "name": "Neurogenesis", "description": "An examination of the molecular and cellular basis of neurogenesis in development and adult nervous systems. Experimental evidence from recent studies in selected invertebrate and vertebrate model systems will be discussed. Topics include neural stem cells, regional specialization of neurogenesis, neuronal and glial differentiation, extrinsic regulation of neurogenesis, adult neurogenesis, and the evolution of neurogenesis. Students are expected to have a basic knowledge of molecular genetics, developmental biology and/or neuroanatomy. Lectures will be complemented by student directed seminars that focus on specialized research studies published in leading scientific journals.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Cell and Systems Biology", "prerequisites": "BIO260H1/HMB265H1, CSB328H1/CSB349H1/(HMB200H1, HMB320H1)", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["V Tropepe"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 581"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 581"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}]}
