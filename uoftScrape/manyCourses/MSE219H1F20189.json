Topics include: Pearson and Hermann-Mauguin symbols, reciprocal space, point group and space group symmetry analysis, stereographic projections. Introduction to tensor analysis of crystalline material properties, and symmetry breakdown by imperfections in crystals. Experimental techniques used to interpret structure and chemistry of solids and their defects will be covered theoretically and in the laboratory including: X-ray diffractometry, optical, electron and scanning probe microscopy, and surface/bulk spectroscopies based on optical, X-ray, electron and ion-beam analysis methods.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Materials Science and Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D Perovic"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "HS 106"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "HS 106"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "HS 106"}], "size": 80, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "WB 47"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "WB 47"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 360"}], "size": 80, "enrolment": 0}]}
