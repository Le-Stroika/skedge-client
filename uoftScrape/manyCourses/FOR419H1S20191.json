Basic principles of forest fuel moisture exchange, fire occurrence and fire behaviour are explored. Emphasis is placed on application of these models to real fire management problems.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Faculty of Forestry", "prerequisites": "One course in quantitative methods, linear algebra or calculus", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["B Wotton"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "ES 4000"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}]}
