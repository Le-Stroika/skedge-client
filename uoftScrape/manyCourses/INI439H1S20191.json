These events are powerful tools for city branding. They are also potential opportunities for social movements and other groups and individuals to highlight their own sets of concerns. This course will explore the challenges and opportunities that cities face in hosting such events.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Innis College", "prerequisites": "12.0 FCEs", "exclusions": "INI430H1 (topic of same name in 2013-14), INI332H1, INI432H1 (2016)", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D Roberts"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "BL 113"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}]}
