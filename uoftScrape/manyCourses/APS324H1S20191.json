It develops personal responses to ideas of justice, bias and marginalization as these affect Engineers and Engineering in general, domestically as well as globally, in projects as well as in contexts such as the workplace and academic environment. Readings will be drawn from current writers on Engineering and Social Justice and students will rehearse action through theatre techniques developed to enable communities to practice and critique action.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Engineering Communications Program", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["P Weiss"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 72000, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 320"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 72000, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 320"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 0}]}
