The individual project can have either a design project focus or a research focus. If the focus is on design then the design project can be either motivated by the\u00a0CIV498H1\u00a0Group Design Project and MIN466 Mineral Project Design experience, or it can be entirely new. The student\u2019s work must culminate in a final design report or a thesis, as well as an oral presentation. The grading of both the final written submission as well as the oral presentation is carried out by the supervising faculty member. \u00a0The Individual Project may be undertaken only once, either in the Fall (F) or Winter (S) Session (0.5 weight), or as a full year (Y) course (1.0 weight).", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil and Mineral Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": ["S Curtis"], "times": [], "size": 20, "enrolment": 0}]}
