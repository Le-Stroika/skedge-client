This course focuses on the core ideas in population genetics and extends to evolutionary genomics. Students are exposed to the mathematical theory underlying evolutionary genetics and will learn the mathematical foundations underlying these ideas. Topics include the population genetics of mutation, migration, drift, and selection, analysis of sequence variation, and the evolution of sexual reproduction.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Ecology and Evolutionary Biology", "prerequisites": "BIO220H1, BIO260H1/HMB265H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["A Agrawal A Cutter"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "MP 134"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "MP 134"}], "size": 80, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "ES 3088"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T5101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "ES 4076"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}]}
