{"id": "CIV313H1S20191", "code": "CIV313H1S", "name": "Reinforced Concrete I", "description": "This course provides an introduction to the design of reinforced concrete structures. Concrete technology, properties of concrete and reinforcing steel, construction practice, and general code requirements are discussed. Analysis and design of members under axial load, flexure, shear, and restraint force are examined in detail. Other aspects of design covered include control of cracks, minimum and maximum reinforcement ratios, fire resistance, durability, distress and failure. A major design project, done in teams of two and accounting for 15% of the final mark, requires students to formulate a complete design for a structural system such as a pedestrian bridge or floor system. Project requirements include consideration of alternative designs in terms of structural efficiency and total costs.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil and Mineral Engineering", "prerequisites": "CIV312H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D Gauvreau"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1170"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "SF 1105"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "SF 2202"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 117"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 0}]}
