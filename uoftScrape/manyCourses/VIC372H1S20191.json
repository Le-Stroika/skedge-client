Such contexts of reception will be considered along with their social, economic, and ethical implications. In this course an additional fee of up to $50 may be charged for activities outside of the classroom (e.g., field trips). Such fees will be confirmed in the course syllabus.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Victoria College", "prerequisites": "Completion of 6.0 FCE", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [1], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["A Sol"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BC 20"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}]}
