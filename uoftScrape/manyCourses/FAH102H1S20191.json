This introduction to the history of art will examine a wide range of objects, selected and discussed in connection with a special theme to be selected by the instructor. Students will be expected to study the history and significance of art through the close reading of selected texts that relate to both art and theory. Special attention will be given to developing essential art historical skills necessary for upper level courses. The topic for each semester will vary based on the instructor. No previous knowledge of history of art or architecture is required. Frequent writing assignments and exercises will be based on readings, lectures, and museum or gallery visits to collections in Toronto.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Art", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "FAH105H5/FAH202H5/VPHB39H3", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Clarke"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "LM 159"}], "size": 208, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 2111"}], "size": 22, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 2111"}], "size": 22, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0103", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "RL 14190"}], "size": 22, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0104", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "RL 14190"}], "size": 22, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0201", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 2111"}], "size": 22, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0202", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 2111"}], "size": 22, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0301", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "UC 148"}], "size": 22, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0302", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "UC 148"}], "size": 22, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0303", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 2114"}], "size": 22, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0304", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 2114"}], "size": 22, "enrolment": 0}]}
