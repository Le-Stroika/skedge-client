{"id": "BCH340H1S20191", "code": "BCH340H1S", "name": "Proteins: from Structure to Proteomics", "description": "Proteins are the main functional units in the cell and are part of almost every biochemical process. They catalyze many metabolic reactions and also play central roles in signaling pathways. Some proteins have crucial structural and mechanical functions. In this course, a detailed overview of protein structure, stability, folding, and protein-ligand interactions will be given with strong emphasis on discussing the basic principles in the field. Biophysical, theoretical, and proteomic methods used to study protein stability and folding and protein-ligand interactions will be presented. Protein misfolding diseases will also be discussed. The course will offer a solid basis in protein biochemistry. It is recommended for those interested in pursuing graduate studies or professional degrees in health or medicine.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Biochemistry", "prerequisites": "BCH210H1/BCH242Y1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["A Chakrabartty H Chan W Houry"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "MS 4279"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "MS 4279"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "MS 4279"}], "size": 80, "enrolment": 0}]}
