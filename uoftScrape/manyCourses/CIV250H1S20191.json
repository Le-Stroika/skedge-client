{"id": "CIV250H1S20191", "code": "CIV250H1S", "name": "Hydraulics and Hydrology", "description": "The hydrologic processes of precipitation and snowmelt, evapotranspiration, ground water movement, and surface and subsurface runoff are examined. Water resources sustainability issues are discussed, including water usage and water shortages, climate change impacts, land use impacts, and source water protection. Conceptual models of the hydrologic cycle and basics of hydrologic modelling are developed, including precipitation estimation, infiltration and abstraction models, runoff hydrographs, the unit hydrograph method and the Rational method. Methods for statistical analysis of hydrologic data, concepts of risk and design, and hydrological consequences of climate change for design are introduced. Principles of open channel hydraulics are introduced. Energy and momentum principles are studied with application to channel transitions, critical flow, choked flow, and hydraulic jumps.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil and Mineral Engineering", "prerequisites": "CME270H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["K Sehgal"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1130"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1130"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1130"}], "size": 125, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 64800, "duration": 10800, "location": "GB 150"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 64800, "duration": 10800, "location": "GB 144"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 54000, "duration": 10800, "location": "WB 255"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 54000, "duration": 10800, "location": "GB 150"}], "size": 63, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "RS 211"}], "size": 125, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1240"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}]}
